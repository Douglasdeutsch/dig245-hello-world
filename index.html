    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

    <h3>Information About Me</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Douglas Deutsch, Class of 2023, Math and Psychology major</li>
      <li>I am taking this course because of a man I met in Okracoke Island. I was in an art gallery, and talking to the person working the desk. He was telling me that he designs websites and digitizes artwork to make money, and lives most of the year on a sailboat. Website design seems like the perfect skill to have in the current age and the freedom it can allow seems really cool.</li>
      <li>I hope to become very familiar with the language of webste design by the end of this course.</li>
      <li>Git version control - The reason to use version control is to have a way to organize different copies of a file. You duplicate your files when you are making changes so that you can test them and easily get rid of them when you don't need them. You need version control in order to combine the parts of the code across all of the different version files that you want. The second actvity was the file organization activity. The first part worked on terminal commands and how to view permissions in gitbash.For the questions in file organizations:

        </ol>
      <li>Links to 3 webprojects:</li>
        <ul>
          <li> Radio Garden:  <a href="https://www.radio.garden/">Radio Garden</a>  , This website allows you to tune into any radio station broadcast in the world, and is a truly mind bending tool. It is interesting to hear what is popular in different cultures across the world. </li>
          <li> What football will look like in the future:  <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjx_dWFuYH6AhXklmoFHQxOCgwQFnoECAMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sbnation.com%2Fa%2F17776-football&usg=AOvVaw0-TK4_3FqJdpwaf6Hfgdaa">What Football Will Look Like in the Future</a> , probably one of the most innocent looking websites at first, this turns into one of the most creative story telling mediums that I have every seen. I would highly recommend going all the way through this one. </li>
          <li> Pointer pointer:
<a href="https://pointerpointer.com">Pointer pointer</a> , This website is very simple in function. However, it demostrates how much fun websites can have. It reminds me of when I was very young, and people used the internet more like a toy, such as the popular homemade youtube videos and cheesy imovie effects.
        </ul>
      <li> The assignment was fairly easy, except for the times when the instructions were made for mac computers and not windows, and so I would have to look up the alternative ways to do it. </li>

    </ul>
